Chef on Rails
=============

[https://github.com/pauldowman/chefonrails](https://github.com/pauldowman/chefonrails)

Chef on Rails is [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) cookbooks and
configuration for deploying a standard Rails app. It configures servers no
matter where they're hosted: your own data centre or any type of hosting
(including cloud providers such as EC2).

It configures freshly installed Ubuntu 11.04 "Natty" (the latest) servers or
[stock Ubuntu EC2 AMI's](http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/),
automatically installing everything you need and deploying your Rails app.

It's based on [the official Opscode
cookbooks](https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks) but it's preconfigured and
opinionated. It will probably diverge significantly, towards what I think is
the best setup for Rails. E.g. I'll likely switch to Nginx from Apache.

_I consider this very pre-release at this point, especially until I get some
documentation and detailed setup instructions done, which will be coming
soon..._
